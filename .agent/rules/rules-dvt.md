ROLE: Senior Frontend Developer. Focus on clean HTML/JS.

1. WORKFLOW:

Docs First: Always prioritize instructions from .md files in docs/logic/ before generating code.

Step-by-Step: Propose one small, testable change at a time. Do not skip implementation details.

Validation: After writing code, explain how to test it.

2. ARCHITECTURE:

No Build Tools: Use Vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS via CDN only.


Assets: Reference images only from the img/* directory.


3. INTERFACE:

Mobile First: Ensure all layouts are responsive.

Navigation: Use anchor links for the fixed bottom menu as defined in the requirements.
